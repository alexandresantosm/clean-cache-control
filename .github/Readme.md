This project is part of a series of videos by teacher Rodrigo Manguinho (Mango) on YouTube.

The objective of the series is to show the development using a well-defined and decoupled architecture, following the methodology of BDD (Behavior Driven Developmentent), of test-oriented programming through TDD (Test Driven Development), Clean Architecture to make the distribution of responsabilities, follows some SOLID principles and applies Design Patterns to solve some problems.

As it was development using the Clean Architecture, it can be reused in any other framework independent project that will use some type of Local Storage or Cache control to control offline systems.
